import { Tabs, TabItem } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';

The Countries resource provides details about countries and territories
(henceforth referred to as countries for short) in the OpenAQ dataset and
includes only those with monitoring locations from which OpenAQ ingests data.
You can use it to get a country's air quality data information: the time of
its first and most recent measurement on OpenAQ, the parameters
that are being measured in the country. All country values come from the
coordinates provided by the upstream provider. OpenAQ uses the [Natural Earth
10m dataset](https://www.naturalearthdata.com/) for country boundaries. Country
codes follow the [ISO 3166-1
alpha-2](https://www.iso.org/iso-3166-country-codes.html) standard, which may
differ from codes reported by the upstream provider.

## Methods

The Countries resource provides the following methods:

- `get()` - For accessing a single country by country ID.
- `list()` - For accessing multiple countries.

### Get a single country

The `get()` method accepts one single `countries_id` as an argument and returns
details about that country in a CountriesResponse object.

```py
get(
  countries_id: int
  ) -> CountriesResponse
```

#### *Query arguments*

| argument | description | input requirements |
| -------- | ----------- | ---- |
| countries_id | `int` OpenAQ's unique ID for each country | Required |

#### *Example*

<Tabs syncKey="client">
  <TabItem label="sync">
```py
from openaq import OpenAQ

# Retrieve information about Indonesia (ID=1) on OpenAQ
with OpenAQ() as client:
    client.countries.get(countries_id=1)
```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="async">
```py
from openaq import AsyncOpenAQ

# Retrieve information about Indonesia (ID=1) on OpenAQ
async with AsyncOpenAQ() as client:
    await client.countries.get(countries_id=1)
```
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

### List multiple countries

The `list()` method takes optional arguments and returns countries on the
OpenAQ platform that meet all the conditions specified. If no argument is included,
the method returns all countries using the default arguments.

```py
list(
  page: int = 1,
  limit: int = 1000,
  order_by: str | None = None,
  sort_order: SortOrder | None = None,
  parameters_id: int | list[int] | None = None,
  providers_id: int | list[int] | None = None
  ) -> CountriesResponse
```

#### *Query arguments*

| argument | description | input requirements |
| -------- | ----------- | ------------------ |
| page | `int` The page number to retrieve, defaults to 1 | Must be greater than zero |
| limit | `int` The number of results returned per page, defaults to 1,000 | Must be between 1 and 1,000 |
| order_by | `str \| None` The country field by which to sort results, defaults to `id`. Currently only `id` is supported | |
| sort_order | `SortOrder \| None` The sort direction for the `order_by` field, defaults to `desc` | Must be one of: `asc`, `desc`, `ASC`, `DESC` |
| parameters_id | `int \| list[int] \| None` Filter by a pollutant or meteorological parameter | Must be OpenAQ unique ID for the pollutant or meteorlogical parameter |
| providers_id | `int \| list[int] \| None` Filter by the ID of the data provider | Must be OpenAQ unique ID for the provider that facilitates data sharing |

#### *Example*

<Tabs syncKey="client">
  <TabItem label="sync">
```py
from openaq import OpenAQ

# List countries where there is a PM2.5 reading and where AirGradient is present 
# as a data provider
with OpenAQ() as client:
    client.countries.list(parameters_id=2,
                          providers_id=66)
```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="async">
```py
from openaq import AsyncOpenAQ

# List countries where there is a PM2.5 reading and where AirGradient is present 
# as a data provider
async with AsyncOpenAQ() as client:
    await client.countries.list(parameters_id=2,
                                providers_id=66)
```
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Response objects

The Country object contains attributes that have all data about
them. The hierarchy below presents the depth of the attributes and their
datatypes.
