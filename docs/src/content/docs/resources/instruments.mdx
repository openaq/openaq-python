The Instruments resource provides information about the air quality measuring
devices that gather the data at each monitoring location. You can use it to get
an instrument's available details: name, manufacturer, and whether it is used
for regulatory purposes.

## Methods

The Instruments resource provides the following methods:

- `get()` - For accessing a single instrument by instrument ID.
- `list()` - For accessing multiple instruments.

### Get a single instrument

The `get()` method accepts one single `instruments_id` as an argument and returns
details about that instrument in a InstrumentsResponse object.

```py
get(
  instruments_id: int
  ) -> InstrumentsResponse
```

#### *Query arguments*

| argument | description | input requirements |
| -------- | ----------- | ---- |
| instruments_id | `int` OpenAQ's unique ID for each instrument | Required |

#### *Example*

<Tabs syncKey="client">
  <TabItem label="sync">
    ```py
    from openaq import OpenAQ

    # Retrieve information about the instrument with ID=1 on OpenAQ
    with OpenAQ() as client:
        client.instruments.get(instruments_id=1)
    ```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="async">
    ```py
    from openaq import AsyncOpenAQ

    # Retrieve information about the instrument with ID=1 on OpenAQ
    async with AsyncOpenAQ() as client:
        await client.instruments.get(instruments_id=1)
    ```
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

### List multiple instruments

The `list()` method takes optional arguments and returns instruments on the
OpenAQ platform that meet all the conditions specified. If no argument is included,
the method returns all instruments using the default arguments.

```py
list(
  page: int = 1,
  limit: int = 1000,
  order_by: str | None = None,
  sort_order: SortOrder | None = None
  ) -> InstrumentsResponse
```

#### *Query arguments*

| argument | description | input requirements |
| -------- | ----------- | ------------------ |
| page | `int` The page number to retrieve, defaults to 1 | Must be greater than zero |
| limit | `int` The number of results returned per page, defaults to 1,000 | Must be between 1 and 1,000 |
| order_by | `str \| None` The instrument field by which to sort results, defaults to `id`. Currently only `id` is supported | |
| sort_order | `SortOrder \| None` The sort direction for the `order_by` field, defaults to `desc` | Must be one of: `asc`, `desc`, `ASC`, `DESC` |

#### *Example*

<Tabs syncKey="client">
  <TabItem label="sync">
    ```py
    from openaq import OpenAQ

    # List all instruments on OpenAQ
    with OpenAQ() as client:
        client.instruments.list()
    ```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="async">
    ```py
    from openaq import AsyncOpenAQ

    # List all instruments on OpenAQ
    async with AsyncOpenAQ() as client:
        await client.instruments.list()
    ```
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Response objects

The Instrument object contains attributes that have all data about
them. The hierarchy below presents the depth of the attributes and their
datatypes.
