The Licenses resource provides information about the licenses that govern the
use of data in OpenAQ. You can use it to get details about each license's
permissions and restrictions, such as whether attribution is required and
whether commercial use, modification, or redistribution is allowed. This
resource is most helpful to identify licensing requirements and ensure
compliance with [OpenAQ's Terms of Use](https://docs.openaq.org/about/terms).

## Methods

The Licenses resource provides the following methods:

- `get()` - For accessing a single license by license ID.
- `list()` - For accessing multiple licenses.

### Get a single license

The `get()` method accepts one single `licenses_id` as an argument and returns
details about that license in a LicensesResponse object.

```py
get(
  licenses_id: int
  ) -> LicensesResponse
```

#### *Query arguments*

| argument | description | input requirements |
| -------- | ----------- | ------------------ |
| licenses_id |  `int` OpenAQ's unique ID for each license | Required |

#### *Example*

<Tabs syncKey="client">
  <TabItem label="sync">
```py
from openaq import OpenAQ

# Retrieve the license with ID 1
with OpenAQ() as client:
    client.licenses.get(licenses_id=1)
```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="async">
```py
from openaq import AsyncOpenAQ

# Retrieve the license with ID 1
async with AsyncOpenAQ() as client:
    await client.licenses.get(licenses_id=1)
```
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

### List multiple licenses

The `list()` method takes optional arguments and returns all licenses on the
OpenAQ platform that meet all the conditions specified. If no argument is included,
the method returns all licenses using the default arguments.

```py
list(
  page: int = 1,
  limit: int = 1000,
  order_by: str | None = None,
  sort_order: SortOrder | None = None
  ) -> LicensesResponse
```

#### *Query arguments*

| argument | description | input requirements |
| -------- | ----------- | ------------------ |
| page | `int` The page number to retrieve, defaults to 1 | Must be greater than zero |
| limit | `int` The number of results returned per page, defaults to 1,000 | Must be between 1 and 1,000 |
| order_by | `str \| None` The license field by which to sort results, defaults to `id`. Currently only `id` is supported | |
| sort_order | `str \| None` The sort direction for the `order_by` field, defaults to `desc` | Must be one of: `asc`, `desc`, `ASC`, `DESC` |

#### *Example*

<Tabs syncKey="client">
  <TabItem label="sync">
```py
from openaq import OpenAQ

# List all licenses on OpenAQ
with OpenAQ() as client:
    client.licenses.list()
```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="async">
```py
from openaq import AsyncOpenAQ

# List all licenses on OpenAQ
async with AsyncOpenAQ() as client:
    await client.licenses.list()
```
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Response

The Licenses object contains attributes that have all data about
them. The hierarchy below presents the depth of the attributes and their
datatypes.
