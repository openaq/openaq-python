title: Rate limiting
---

By default the OpenAQ Python SDK provides automatic rate limiting, where the 
client class will track and ensure that the API rate limit is not exceeded. For 
more fine grained control of the client class this option can be toggled off 
by setting the `auto_wait` option to `False`. e.g.

```py 
from openaq import OpenAQ

client = OpenAQ(auto_wait=False)

```

:::caution
Turning off automatic rate limiting removes protection to help ensure you do 
not inadvently exceed the API rate limit. Only toggle this option off if you
have a specific need for fine-grained timing of requests and understand how 
to use the rate-limit headers to control your requests. Exceeding the rate limit
will result in temporary or permanent account suspension.

## Rate limit headers

The OpenAQ API provides HTTP headers that include information on current rate
limit usage.
