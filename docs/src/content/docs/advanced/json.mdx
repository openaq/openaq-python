title: orjson JSON serialization
---

The OpenAQ SDK provides optional support for `orjson` for JSON serialization.
This may provide up to [2x speed performance]() when serializing a response
object to JSON. This may be a useful optimization if performance is crucial for
your application and you need to serialize data to JSON.

`orjson` is an optional dependency and can be installed with:

```sh
pip install openaq[orjson]
```

Then when serializing results pass the orjson pass to the `json()` method's 
encoder parameter, which defaults to the built-in `json` module:

```py
import orjson

# create a client
# ...
# call a resource

res.json(encoder = orjson)

```
