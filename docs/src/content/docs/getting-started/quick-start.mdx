This tutorial provide a quick start for making your first OpenAQ query using the 
OpenAQ Python SDK. The simplest example we can query a single air quality
monitoring location and get information, such as the location's name, from the
response.

## Tutorial

<Steps>

1. Install the openaq package from [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/openaq/): 

    ```sh
    pip install openaq
    ```

2. Get an API key

    Visit [explore.openaq.org/register](https://explore.openaq.org/register) and
    copy your API key.


3. Run the following code in a Python REPL or from a .py file:

    ```py
    from openaq import OpenAQ

    client = OpenAQ(api_key='replace-me-with-a-valid-key')

    location = client.locations.get(2178)

    client.close()

    print(location.results[0].name)
    ```

    This will print out `Del Norte` in your console, the name of the location
    with ID 2178.

 </Steps>

## Walkthrough


Now we can walk through the code step by step:


<Steps>

1. Import the client class from the `openaq` package. The `OpenAQ` client
provides all the options for querying resources.

    ```py {1}
    from openaq import OpenAQ

    client = OpenAQ(api_key='replace-me-with-a-valid-key')

    location = client.locations.get(2178)

    client.close()

    print(location.results[0].name)
    ```

2. Set up the client. Provide an API key to the client to authenticate with the 
OpenAQ API. Replace the value `replace-me-with-a-valid-key` with you actual 
API key, this placeholder **will not work**.

    ```py {3}
    from openaq import OpenAQ

    client = OpenAQ(api_key='replace-me-with-a-valid-key')

    location = client.locations.get(2178)

    client.close()

    print(location.results[0].name)
    ```

3. Query the location by ID. We've chose locations ID 2178, you can replace this 
with another other OpenAQ locations ID.

    ```py {5}
    from openaq import OpenAQ

    client = OpenAQ(api_key='replace-me-with-a-valid-key')

    location = client.locations.get(2178)

    client.close()

    print(location.results[0].name)
    ```

4. Close the connection. 

    ```py {7}
    from openaq import OpenAQ

    client = OpenAQ(api_key='replace-me-with-a-valid-key')

    location = client.locations.get(2178)

    client.close()

    print(location.results[0].name)
    ```

5. Print the results. 

    ```py {9}
    from openaq import OpenAQ

    client = OpenAQ(api_key='replace-me-with-a-valid-key')

    location = client.locations.get(2178)

    client.close()

    print(location.results[0].name)
    ```
 </Steps>
