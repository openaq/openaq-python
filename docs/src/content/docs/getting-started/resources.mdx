title: Resources
---


The OpenAQ API follows a resource-based design, where each endpoint returns a 
response corresponding to the endpoint. The OpenAQ Python SDK further simplifies
this by providing convenient resources from the client with methods to call the 
endpoints. All API responses through the SDK provide common features for reading
data as convenient Python objects, a dictionary or a JSON string.
