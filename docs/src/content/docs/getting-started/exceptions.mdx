title: Exceptions
---

The OpenAQ Python SDK raises exceptions when an error occurs. The package
includes two main exception types: `OpenAQError` and `APIError`.

Using `try` and `except` blocks gives you a predictable interface for catching
errors and identifying the specific error class.

### OpenAQ error

The `OpenAQError` class serves as a superclass for exceptions that show the
OpenAQ SDK client or methods found an issue and threw an exception _before_
sending a request to the API.

All `OpenAQError` exceptions include a `message` field with a human-readable
explanation of the error.

```py
try:
    client = OpenAQ() # raises ApiKeyMissingError since no key is provided
except ApiKeyMissingError as e:
    print(e.message)
```

### API error

The `APIError` class serves as a superclass for exceptions that show an error
occurred _after_ the request to the API. All `APIError` exceptions wrap HTTP
error codes (4xx and 5xx) and expose the `status_code` from the response body.

All `APIError` exceptions include `message` and `status_code` fields with a
human-readable explanation of the error and the HTTP status code number,
respectively.

```py
from openaq import OpenAQ 

with client as OpenAQ(api_key='replace-with-valid-openaq-api-key'):
    try:
        client.countries.get(999)
    except NotFoundError as e:
        print(e.message) # Country not found
        print(e.status_code) # 404
```

See the Exception reference documentation for a detailed list of exceptions.
