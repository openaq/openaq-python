title: Exceptions
---

The OpenAQ Python SDK raises exceptions when an error occurs. Custom exceptions
included in the package include two main types: `OpenAQError` and `APIError`.

Using `try` and `except` the exception allow a more predictable interface for 
catching errors and identifying the specific class of error thrown. 

### OpenAQError 

`OpenAQError` is a superclass that is inherited by exceptions that indicate the
OpenAQ SDK client or methods has found an issue and throws an exception _before_
making a request to the API.

```py
try:
    client = OpenAQ() # raises ApiKeyMissingError since no key is provided
except ApiKeyMissingError as e:
    print(e)
```

### APIError

`APIError` is a superclass that is inherited by exceptions that indicate an 
error has occured _after_ the request to the API has been made. `APIError` 
exceptions are all wrappers around HTTP Error codes (4xx and 5xx) and provide
access to the `status_code` in the body of the exception:

```py
from openaq import OpenAQ 

with client as OpenAQ(api_key='replace-with-valid-openaq-api-key'):
    try:
        client.countries.get(999)
    except NotFoundError as e:
        print(e.message) # Country not found
        print(e.status_code) # 404
```
