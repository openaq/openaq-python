title: Pagination
---

The OpenAQ platform contains a large amount of data, and the OpenAQ API
can only return a subset in a single request. Pagination lets you query large
result sets across many requests.

## Page and limit

The OpenAQ Python SDK provides `page` and `limit` arguments for all resources
with a `list()` method.

- `page` - the page number to retrieve. Defaults to `1`. Must exceed zero.
- `limit` - the number of results per page. Defaults to `100`. Must range from
`1` to `1000`.

To retrieve the first 50 results:
```py
locations = client.locations.list(page=1, limit=50)
```

To retrieve the next 50 results, increment `page`:
```py
locations = client.locations.list(page=2, limit=50)
```

To paginate through an entire result set, use a `for` loop:
```py
import math

limit = 100
locations = []

first_page = client.locations.list(page=1, limit=limit)
locations.extend(first_page.results)
total_pages = math.ceil(first_page.meta.found / limit)

for page in range(2, total_pages + 1):
    response = client.locations.list(page=page, limit=limit)
    locations.extend(response.results)
```

## The meta object

All `list()` responses include a `meta` object with metadata about the result
set. The `meta.found` field holds the total number of records matching your
query, which you can use to calculate the total page count as shown preceding.

When `meta.found` returns `'>1000'`, you can't calculate the exact page count
ahead of time. Consider narrowing your query with filters like `countries_id`
or `parameters_id` to reduce the result set. See the meta object reference for
a full list of available fields.
