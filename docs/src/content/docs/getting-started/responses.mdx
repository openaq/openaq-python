title: Responses
---

The OpenAQ API and Python SDK use a common response format to ensure
consistency. The Python SDK automatically deserializes API responses and
transforms raw JSON into convenient Python objects with dot notation access.
This design simplifies data retrieval and reduces boilerplate code while
maintaining flexibility. You can still access raw JSON or dictionary formats
when needed. Understanding this response structure helps you work effectively
with any OpenAQ resource.



## Response structure

All response objects follow a common top-level form, with specific data objects
for each resource within the results. The `results` object in each response
remains a `list`, or array in JSON. This applies even when requesting a single
object by keys, like in a `get()` function call, or when filtering removes all
possible results. In those cases, you receive an empty list.

```
├── headers
│   ├── x_ratelimit_limit: int | None
│   ├── x_ratelimit_remaining: int | None
│   ├── x_ratelimit_used: int | None
│   └── x_ratelimit_reset: int | None
├── meta
│   ├── name: str
│   ├── website: str
│   ├── page: int
│   ├── limit: int
│   └── found: int
└── results: list[]
```

pages in next section of the docs.

## Accessing response data

The SDK provides three ways to access response data, depending on your needs.

### Response objects

By default, resource methods deserialize OpenAQ API JSON responses into data
objects for easier access. These data objects support convenient dot notation
access to attributes. You can retrieve values directly from the response
structure shown above.

```py
response.meta.page
response.headers.x_ratelimit_remaining
response.results[0]  # Access first item in results list
```

### Dictionary

You can also return responses as a Python dictionary. All resource responses
include a `dict()` method that allows property access using Python dictionary
key syntax:

```py
response.dict()['results']
```

or using the built-in `get()`:
```py
response.dict().get('results')
```

Just like in the deserialized object, the `results` key stays a Python `list`.


### JSON

Response objects also provide the option to return the raw JSON string of the 
esponse payload. Access this on all response objects with the `json()` method:

```py
response.json()
```
