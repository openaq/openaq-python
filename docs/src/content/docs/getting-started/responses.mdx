title: Responses
---

The OpenAQ API follows a resource-based design, where each endpoint returns a 
response corresponding to the endpoint. The OpenAQ Python SDK further simplifies
this by providing convenient resources from the client with methods to call the 
endpoints. All API responses through the SDK provide common features for reading
data as convenient Python objects, a dictionary or a JSON string. 

## Response objects

By default, resource methods return OpenAQ API JSON responses into deserialized
data objects for easier access. These data objects support convenient dot
notation access to attributes, allowing you to retrieve values like
`response.meta.page` or `response.headers.x_ratelimit_remaining` instead of
using dictionary-style key lookups.

All response objects follow a common top-level form, with specific data objects
for each specific resources within the results.

```
├── headers
│   ├── x_ratelimit_limit: int | None
│   ├── x_ratelimit_remaining: int | None
│   ├── x_ratelimit_used: int | None
│   └── x_ratelimit_reset: int | None
├── meta
│   ├── name: str
│   ├── website: str
│   ├── page: int
│   ├── limit: int
│   └── found: int
└── results: list[]
```

The structure of individual resource response objects can be found in their
respective pages (locations, providers, measurements etc.)


## Dictionary

Responses can also be optionally returned as a Python dictionary. All resource 
responses include a `dict()` method which will allow property access using 
Python dictionary key syntax:

```py
response.dict()['results']
```

or using the built-in `get()`:

```py
response.dict().get('results')
```


## JSON

The response objects also provide the option to return the raw JSON string of 
the response payload. This can be accessed on all response objects with the 
`json()` method.

```py
response.json()
```
