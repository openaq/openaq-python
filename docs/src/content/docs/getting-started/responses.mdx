The OpenAQ API and in turn the Python SDK return a common format for the 
responses to ensure a consistent and predictable interface. The Python SDK
handles 

## Response objects

By default, resource methods return OpenAQ API JSON responses into deserialized
data objects for easier access. These data objects support convenient dot
notation access to attributes, allowing you to retrieve values like
`response.meta.page` or `response.headers.x_ratelimit_remaining` instead of
using dictionary-style key lookups.

All response objects follow a common top-level form, with specific data objects
for each specific resources within the results. The results object in each
response will _always_ be a `list` (or array in JSON), this applies even if 
requesting a single object by keys, like in `get()` function call, or if
filtering removes all possible results; you will recieve an empty list.

```
├── headers
│   ├── x_ratelimit_limit: int | None
│   ├── x_ratelimit_remaining: int | None
│   ├── x_ratelimit_used: int | None
│   └── x_ratelimit_reset: int | None
├── meta
│   ├── name: str
│   ├── website: str
│   ├── page: int
│   ├── limit: int
│   └── found: int
└── results: list[]
```

The structure of individual resource response objects can be found in their
respective pages (locations, providers, measurements etc.)


## Dictionary

Responses can also be optionally returned as a Python dictionary. All resource 
responses include a `dict()` method which will allow property access using 
Python dictionary key syntax:

```py
response.dict()['results']
```

or using the built-in `get()`:

```py
response.dict().get('results')
```

Just like in the deserialized object, the `results` key will always be a Python
`list`.


## JSON

The response objects also provide the option to return the raw JSON string of 
the response payload. This can be accessed on all response objects with the 
`json()` method.

```py
response.json()
```
