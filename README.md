## Development

Code is styled according to [black](https://github.com/psf/black), imports are sorted using [isort](https://pycqa.github.io/isort/), and code is linted using [ruff](https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff).

Codebase can be automatically formatted and linted by running:

```console
hatch run style:fmt
```

style can be checked with:

```console
hatch run style:check
```

Testing uses [pytest](https://docs.pytest.org/en/7.4.x/).

```console
hatch run test:test
```

Code coverage can be viewed with:

```console
hatch run test:cov
```

## Acknowledgements

For many years [py-openaq](https://github.com/dhhagan/py-openaq) by David Hagan filled the gap for a Python API SDK for the OpenAQ API. Thank you to David for many years of maintaining py-openaq and for taking the original step to develop a Python tool for OpenAQ.
